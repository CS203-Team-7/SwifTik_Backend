# SwifTik_Backend
A Ticketing website that is worthy of hosting swifties all around the world!! #TaylorSwift
This backend website implements a unique raffling system to ensure fairness and reliability when it comes to allocating tickets for concerts. We believe this system to be more fair compared to the general queueing systems in place today. This application was created by Team 7 Group 2 - CS203 (Collaborative Software Development)

# Things to note:
To successfully run this application on your device, you will need JDK 17 and Maven on your device. Furthermore since this app uses the Twilio API for OTP verification and messages, you will need to provide a Twilio API Token, SID and phone number in an environment variables file. Without the Twilio configurations, you will not be able to access the full potential of this website!
